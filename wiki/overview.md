# Wiki Overview

Navigation: [[index]] | [[hot]] | [[log]] | [[dashboard]]

## Purpose

This is the claude-obsidian demo vault. It demonstrates the [[LLM Wiki Pattern]] — a system for building persistent, compounding knowledge bases using Claude and Obsidian.

Run `/wiki` to scaffold this vault for your own domain and replace this overview.

## Key Themes

**Knowledge compounds.** Unlike RAG, the wiki pre-compiles synthesis. Cross-references are already there. Contradictions are flagged. Every ingest enriches existing pages rather than adding isolated chunks.

**The hot cache is the force multiplier.** A ~500-word file captures recent context. New sessions start with full context at minimal token cost.

**Obsidian is the IDE, Claude is the programmer.** The graph view shows what's connected. The human curates sources and asks questions. Claude writes and maintains everything else.
